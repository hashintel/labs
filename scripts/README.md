Scripts!

We write our scripts using typescript and the shelljs library.

This give us a cross-platform way to run all of our scripts,
and bonus points-- we get type checking a lot of our scripting logic!

To run a script, use `ts-node [script].ts`.

See the [ShellJs CheatSheet](https://devhints.io/shelljs) and the [ShellJS Docs](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs) to see the powers you have.
