# hCore

This crate provides an interface through which HASH simulations can be developed.

Combine `simulation` with your interface of choice, and pass in simulations using the HASH simulation file format.

The easisest way to get started is to combine H-Core with the local interface to begin building extremely fast agent-based models.
